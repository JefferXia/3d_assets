Motion: "New State Style" (or "Victory Dance 60") from the game PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds),
converted to VMD by JohnyL.
There's no camera and no facial expression.

***IMPORTANT***
When using this motion, please credit "PUBG Studios" or "Krafton" (I think either is okay).
I will be very grateful if you also credit "JohnyL". It's fine if you don't want to. (^-^)

NOTE: Some models are not allowed to use ripped motion, please read the rules of your model's creator carefully!
To the Japanese MMD community, be careful because this is a game ripped motion. Please follow Japanese law. /

Use this motion at your own risk! I will not be responsible for any damage when you use it!
***************

<<<About fitting the motion>>>
Your models need to have upperbody2 bone (上半身2), and in A-pose.
The motion fits to Tda Miku Hatsune Append (Tda式初音ミク・アペンドVer1.10).
If your models are too big or too small, you can resize them to match her height, or use VMD Sizing tool with her.
The game model's shoulders are wider than Miku's so her hands clip through her arms.
I included a second VMD file to avoid that.

<<<About the motion>>>
The motion is called "New State Style" (or "Victory Dance 60") and the music is unknown
as it was made by the game devs.
Frame 10 is identical to frame 908.

<<<Side notes>>>
The included music file was extracted from the game. I extended and added fade out effect at the end.
I removed the first 8 frames from the original animation to get rid of the default standing idle pose.

That's all. Thanks for reading!
