Motion: "The Magic Bomb" from the game PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds), converted to VMD by JohnyL.
There's no camera and no facial expression.

***************

<<<About fitting the motion>>>
Your models need to have upperbody2 bone (上半身2).
The motion fits to Tda Miku Hatsune Append (Tda式初音ミク・アペンドVer1.10).
If your models are too big or too small, you can resize them to match her height, or use VMD Sizing tool with her.
Some models with wider shoulders than Miku won't clap their hands. To fix it, in TransformView of PmxEditor,
rotate the arm (not shoulder) down a bit (see "HowToClap.jpg" for reference angle),
then from menu of TransformView click "File", uncheck the "Vertex Morph Normalize",
after that select "Save Model" in the same menu to save as a new rest pose ("_ShapeChange").

<<<About the motion>>>
In the game, the animation loops from frame 54 to frame 1271. I also include a loop version of the motion.

<<<Side notes>>>
The included music file was extracted from the game.
I removed the first 7 frames from the original animation to get rid of the default standing idle pose.

That's all. Thanks for reading!
