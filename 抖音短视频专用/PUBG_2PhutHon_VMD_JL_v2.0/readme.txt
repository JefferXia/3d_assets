Motion: "2 Phut Hon" from the game PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds), converted to VMD by JohnyL.
There's no camera and no facial expression.

I will be very grateful if you also credit "JohnyL". It's fine if you don't want to. (^-^)

<<<About fitting the motion>>>
Your models need to have upperbody2 bone (上半身2).
The motion fits to Tda Miku Hatsune Append (Tda式初音ミク・アペンドVer1.10).
If your models are too big or too small, you can resize them to match her height, or use VMD Sizing tool with her.

<<<About the motion>>>
In the game, the animation loops from frame 8 to frame 908. I also include a loop version of the motion.

<<<Side notes>>>
The included music file was extracted from the game. I extended and added fade out effect at the end.
I removed the first 6 frames from the original animation to get rid of the default standing idle pose.
The wrist of the original animation is twisted in the first 3 frames and from frame 220 to 270 so I included a fix.

That's all. Thanks for reading!
